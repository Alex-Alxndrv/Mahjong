This GUI is pretty much plug-n play. Although you can use it as a striate replacement for the standard skin, it does have a lot of custom styles. You’ll need to add script to use most of them. This package includes a javascript with some examples of how to use the custom styles. If you add to this skin please share your additions with the community.
Have fun.
